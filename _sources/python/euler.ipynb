    "## Problem 96: Sudoku\n",
    "\n",
    "[Problem 96](https://projecteuler.net/problem=96) is one of my favorites.\n",
    "The goal is to solve a [Sudoku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku) puzzle algorithmically.\n",
    "The crude brute force method is obviously too slow, but the space of possible valid solutions can be drastically reduced by applying the constraints of the game: each digit 1 to 9 must be present in each row, column, and 3 by 3 subgrid.\n",
    "I settled on an algorithm that systematically fills one digit at a time with a candidate solution, i.e. one that satisfies the Sudoku constraints.\n",
    "It keeps on filling digits until either the grid is complete, meaning the puzzle has been solved, or no candidate solutions exist.\n",
    "In the latter case, the algorithm must backtrack to a previous state that could have more candidate solutions, and continue its search.\n",
    "I implemented this guess and backtrack via recursion.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{margin}\n",
    "The current puzzle was designed to be difficult (for humans, at least) by mathematician Arto Inkala, taken from [this article](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/science-news/9359579/Worlds-hardest-sudoku-can-you-crack-it.html).\n",

    "Hover over the {fa}`rocket` launch button at the top of this page, then click the {guilabel}`Live Code` button.\n",
