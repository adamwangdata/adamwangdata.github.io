# Project Euler

[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/about) is a series of computational challenges that, generally speaking, can be solved by a computer in less than a minute.
At least, that was my goal when solving them.

The magic 100 number may also have been motivated by [Wes McKinney's blog post](https://wesmckinney.com/blog/im-moving-to-san-francisco-and-hiring/) where he gives "Extra points if you have [solved 100 or more problems on Project Euler]".

Occasionally the simplest brute force algorithm works, but often clever modifications are required.
In many cases, advanced mathematics (e.g. number theory) is required, which is why I stopped after 100 problems.
You can find my all 100 of my solutions LINK, but I thought I'd highlight a few particularly interesting ones.
