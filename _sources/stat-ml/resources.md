# More Examples and Learning Resources

Much of my knowledge of statistics and machine learning comes from reading and working through books.
This means completing every exercise I find interesting or do not immediately know how to solve, filling gaps in my knowledge, and extending topics presented in the book.
I've worked through the following books:

- [*Introduction to Machine Learning with Python* (2016)](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/introduction-to-machine/9781449369880/) by Andreas MÃ¼ller and Sarah Guido
- [*Python for Data Analysis* (2017)](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/python-for-data/9781491957653/) by Wes McKinney
- [*Statistics* (2007)](https://www.amazon.com/Statistics-4th-David-Freedman/dp/8130915871) by David Freedman, Robert Pisani, and Roger Purves
- [*Introduction to Statistical Learning* (2013)](https://www.statlearning.com/) by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie, and Robert Tibshirani
- [*Linear Models with R* (2014)](https://julianfaraway.github.io/faraway/LMR/) by Julian Faraway
- [*Mathematical Statistics with Applications* (2008)](https://www.amazon.com/Mathematical-Statistics-Applications-Dennis-Wackerly/dp/0495110817) by Dennis Wackerly, William Mendenhall, and Richard Scheaffer

My complete accompaniments for the last two books, totaling over 300 pages, can be found [here](https://github.com/adamwangdata/adamwangdata.github.io/tree/main/supplemental/stat-ml).
