# Learning Resources

I've worked through the following books in detail:

- [*Linear Models with R* (2014)](https://julianfaraway.github.io/faraway/LMR/) by Julian Faraway
- [*Mathematical Statistics with Applications* (2008)](https://www.amazon.com/Mathematical-Statistics-Applications-Dennis-Wackerly/dp/0495110817) by Dennis Wackerly, William Mendenhall, and Richard Scheaffer

I completed all exercises that are interesting or potentially insightful, filled gaps in my knowledge, and extended topics presented in the books.
My complete accompaniments, totaling over 300 pages, can be found [here](https://github.com/adamwangdata/adamwangdata.github.io/tree/main/stat-ml-examples).
