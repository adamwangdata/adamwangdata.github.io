Their menu includes everything from salads to breakfast items to dinner plates and snacks. We received a variety and not only was it delicious, it was healthy and filling! Salads are typically not our first choice, but we were so impressed with how much flavor was packed into each one and am already craving them again!

We have tried other meal delivery services but were impressed with Farmer's Fridge the most. The convenience of the order, the ease of preparing the meal, and the overall quality and healthy options puts them above the competition. We can't wait to try more of their menu!

Below the Block Thirty Seven, there's a pedway that connects the R-B ""L"" Washington stations.  This vending machine is near the entry to Red Line.

At 1:30pm, there were still good selections of salad.  I tried the shrimp & succotash, featuring romaine, grilled shrimp, asparagus, tomato, roasted, corn, edamame, and yogurt-bail dressing.  Some of the salad entrees ordered from a restaurant tend to be ""dressing-heavy,"" but I actually would like more on this salad.  The basil was very aromatic, and the yogurt portion of the dressing was smooth and didn't taste acidic at all.

Every piece of large shrimps was thoroughly washed and deveined.  Don't get fooled by the appearance of a vending machine.  These shrimps were truly fresh and delicious.

That being said, if you told me before yesterday that I'd ever enjoy eating a full meal from something that could potentially be a transformer I'd call you crazy. The greens are pretty good though.

The machines are stocked with fresh salads daily, and day-old salads are donated to charity. There are silverware and plates on the side of the machines, and little bags to carry the loot with you back to the office. And the machines are very easy to use. Have a problem? Call up the customer hotline and an employee will walk you through your issue.

For salads, I like the Cheater and the Southwest salads. Cheater is like a turkey Cobb with some of the best honey mustard dressing I've ever had -- like lick the jar good. Dressings come in the jar, which is recyclable -- or very easy to reuse for your own homemade salads. They also provide sides of grilled chicken and tofu which you can add to make your salad heartier.

They stock the vending machine every morning and whatever is left over, they donate which is even a better reason to buy these salads. They also have some other items like yogurt, fruit, and nut mix. All very healthy and fresh.

I decided to try this place at the same time that Farmer's Fridge decide to go on sale for a week after the Taste of Chicago. And with that, I decided to make it salad week in the office.

I started my week of with the Cheater salad, moved on a shrimp and succotash, and had a third mediterranean salad before calling it for the week.

Everything about the salad is top-notch. The greens aren't bruised, the jar isn't dropped from on high like in regular vending machines. The shrimp and succotash was my favorite, as the shrimp was cooked perfectly and the perfect temperature coming out of the vending machine (cold!)

The quality of the salad that comes out of the machine ensures that Farmer's Fridge isn't just a novelty; it very well may be the best option for salad in the Loop, at a competitive price (roughly $8 for the cheapest salads). And I felt like the portion size in the jars was huge, or at least large enough to be worth the price.

We did find the machine without too much difficulty.

Apparently the crowd gathering was for the special offer today for a $1.00 per salad. I found it hilarious the salad kiosk was right next to the normal vending machine. Several people were getting salads and then moving right over to the vending machine to grab their M&Ms. I was a little worried about the concept of getting a ""fresh"" salad out of a vending machine, but hey it was pretty fresh. We both went with the High Protein salad (Spinach, Quinoa, broccoli, chickpeas. Corn, peas, dried figs, parmesan, pumpkin seeds, & lemon-tahini dressing). It was pretty good for a $1.00, but I'm not sure how I would feel about paying regular price (whatever that is) with so many food options in the area. Size was decent, but I did think the carbs and sugar percentages were quite high for a salad. If they keep having deals like this I would buy again, but not likely for full price. Just in case you're wondering Kiosk machine was pretty easy to use. I can only see it being slowed down for those not sure regarding selection. They had a woman there showing us the salads as we waited, but I'm sure she won't be there on a daily basis so you might have to deal with slow people at the kiosk reading over everything.

5,Melanie S.,False,"Chicago, IL",684,890,583,0,12/20/2013,False,"Fantastic concept. Great execution.

After weeks and weeks of eating fat-laden, calorie-bomb lunches and dinners (not to mention all the holiday sweets and treats in the office), my body needed something healthy, like a salad. And not a salad I typically go for (disguised as healthy but loaded with fried chicken, cheese or tortilla strips), but one that wouldn't make me hate myself after eating it.

Farmer's Fridge was just the ticket I needed. It's a kiosk/vending machine that offers several varieties of salads daily. The salads come in a recyclable jar, are layered with the respective ingredients, and dressings are included, but packaged separately, so no soggy greens! The food is stored at the perfect temperature. Best of all, the salads are crazy-fresh, super-crunchy, and full of goodness. The salads are delivered to the kiosks around 10:00 am daily and any salads left at the end of the day are donated to a local food pantry.

So far I've tried the ""Cheater,"" a healthy take on a Cobb salad, and the Mediterranean salad. Both were absolutely delicious and chock full of fresh ingredients. Their salads average around 250 calories sans dressing, but their dressings are light, vinaigrette-type ones, so they won't add a lot of calories, and are quite flavorful, so a little goes a long way. For a slight upcharge, proteins can be added to all salads (the lemon-pepper chicken is a favorite) and there's other kinds of snack-like options like veggies and hummus, vegetable pasta salad, or greek yogurt and berries.

My only minor quibbles would be that since the salads are pre-packaged, there is no way to customize. I get it; given their concept, that would be difficult. It's just that some of the salads come with nuts and those of us with food allergies are forced to skip those, and other than the nuts, those salads sound really good! Also, sometimes I get to the kiosk after the initial rush, and they're sold out of a lot of the salads. Again, I understand; they're trying to find a balance between having enough to sell and not a lot left over. I imagine as time goes on, they'll figure it out. I always manage to find something tasty even if my first choice is sold out.

I'm really hoping they add more kiosks in the Loop. Right now, the only one is at 201 N Clark. The kiosks are user-friendly and accept credit cards.

If you'd told me a month ago that I'd ever entertain the thought the eating a salad from a vending machine, I'd have laughed in your face, but now I'm a big fan. Try it for yourself. After all the gluttony of the holiday season, you'll be glad to do something good for yourself.

Cons include that the machine was practically empty when I got there at 12:35. Only 3 kinds of salad left, a bunch of snacks, and no proteins.

The best thing about this place is you can do the pairings as in soup and salad, toast and bowl, salad and toast etc.  I've ordered toast and salad. Southwest quinoa salad and avacado toast(obviously) were my choice.

Toast is literally a slice of bread tossed with garlic Lebneh, avacado and sesame seeds. I guess it's paprica on the top that gives the hint of spice. Overall it's an interesting combinations of flavors.

Quinoa bowl portion is a small bowl, the overall taste is average I'd say ofcourse healthy. When we were placing the order the only option left in salads is the Napa salad so it didn't give us the option to explore much. I am not sure if that's how it is in general or maybe for a this day.

I was excited for this place, but it didn't meet up to my expectations. The workers seemed like they couldn't care less about being there.

I like the healthy aspect though. The Smoked Cheddar Cobb Salad was good! The smoky bbq sunflower seeds made it really great! The cheese needed to be cut more because I kept getting big pieces of cheese that didn't have any smoked flavor. I also got the cauliflower rice. It was better than I thought. They got the asian taste in there, but each bite kept building and it tasted too salty. The food was surprisingly filing.

Part of the new revival food hall. It was one of the few places with a short line because the food was already prepared.  There are a la carte prices by each of the food items but the combos seem to be a better deal for $9.  Food is fresh and filing and feels healthy.  I had the avocado toast and spicy tofu.  I would get the avocado toast again.  The pickled carrots on top were unusual but had a good flavor. I probably wouldn't get the tofu again. It was a good sized portion (see the picture) and had a little kick but it tasted just ok to me.  The guy who took my order was nice and asked if I liked spicy foods because both my choices had spicy elements in the descriptions.

Yelp sentiment leaned toward the protein salad, which was unavailable. There were also recommendations for the Cheater, featuring turkey bacon. I ruled out the highly-rated Southwest for too much green and briefly contemplated the peach offering.

But I decided the shrimp succotash would really raise the stakes, and Farmer's Fridge easily succeeded. Even if not judged by Midwestern airport vending machine standards, the shrimp was fresh and perfectly cooked. The corn and soybeans were capable supporting players.

Love the Jars of their Fresh Signature Salads that are located now in refrigerated vending machines at ORD or Chicago's O'Hare Airport...need a quick salad to take on a flight if you are flying in coach...this is your ""go to"" spot and is probably less expensive and an alternative option to paying for ""coach style boxes"" aboard your flight.

There are two vending machines on at Gate K6 and the other at Gate F6.  They are digital with touch screens that show a picture of the product and describe their ingredients for those ordering.

It's located on the K gate-branch of the departures terminal,1,0,2,O'Hare Airport
5,Sofiya T.,False,"Skokie, IL",50,81,8,0,6/21/2018,False,"This review is actually for the new Farmer's Fridge in the O'Hare Plaza office building 2 miles east of the airport. Once they add a page for it on Yelp, I'll move it there but I figure a vending machine is a vending machine.

I absolutely love it. A lot of office buildings in Chicago have Deli Time which kind of sucks and we also have Fooda (a different restaurant each day sets up shop for 2 hours) which is expensive ($10+) and usually unhealthy. The Farmer's Fridge, on the other hand, is ideal if you're trying to stay healthy. The food also tastes really good and fresh. I had the Southwest Quinoa Bowl today and it was very filling and, because I went easy on the dressing, 350 calories. Each vending machine is touch screen and super easy to use, listing all the ingredients and nutritional info when you select a food item.

The food comes in cute little plastic jars that you can either keep or recycle by putting back into the machine. There are also plates and utensils at the side of the machine. Check out their website for all the options they offer and get there early because the meals sell out quickly.

A downside is that it's pretty pricey, but I'm not surprised. They prepare the food and refill the machines fairly often while giving you good portion sizes. That ain't cheap. Overall, I probably won't buy from it every day but I'll definitely make it a weekly (or twice-weekly) treat. Highly recommend!",3,0,1,O'Hare Airport

But I went to see it anyway. I was so wrong! The packaging and presentation is awesome, and the salads are really good. I liked the Thai noodle salad. They restock the machine daily, and the food is likely fresher than that of some restaurants.",0,1,1,O'Hare Airport
5,Jen L.,False,"San Francisco, CA",110,89,7,0,1/20/2018,False,"Seriously the ONLY good thing about Terminal 2.

I had the misfortune of catching a regional flight out of Terminal 2 on United. The connection from Terminal 1 was tight, and I needed to grab lunch. I passed by a handful of the usual suspects--none of which looked particularly appealing, and stumbled across the Farmer's Fridge.

The food looked not only fresh, but nutritious and delicious. On top of that, it was at least $4 cheaper than anything comparable in that dismal terminal. (Can you tell how much I loathe Terminal 2?)

I chose the Crunchy Thai salad, and my 11 year old chose the Kale Caesar. We enjoyed watching the machine do its vending work, picked up a couple of bowls, utensils, and a bag, and headed to the gate.

Yum yum!  Should I find myself having to fly out of Terminal 2 again, knowing Farmer's Fridge is there might actually make me look forward to it!",4,1,2,O'Hare Airport

I sat there and scrolled on it's I-pad like screen till I found the perfect dish. I settled on a Greek salad.  But this was not any Greek salad, it was truly the glass slipper of the salad world and I Cinderella. The fresh, crisp, ingredients greeted my taste buds, and completed a dance in my mouth.

5,Danielle T.,False,"Ward Two, Somerville, MA",196,5,0,0,5/28/2019,False,"After a week of feasting on hot dogs, deep dish pizza, and other foods that Chicago had to offer, I was in serious need of eating something at LEAST somewhat healthy. I was walking through the terminal and stumbled upon this vending machine. I normally walk past food in vending machines because I just automatically question freshness and never know when it's been replenished. I was on the verge of being hangry, so after doing some reading about farmers fridge online, i found a 50% coupon on their website. I decided to try after getting the coupon and opted for the Asian chopped salad ($9) and chicken for the salad ($3). So the jar is deceiving and the salad is actually a pretty hefty portion. I had a really difficult time mixing the salad because it was really stuffed into the jar - I pour it in two of the bowls they offer to hold the salad and mix the dressing in (very carefully and deliberately so as not to lose any lettuce leaves). Wow the salad was so surprisingly fresh. The lettuce was super crispy and nothing in the jar was wilted. I was honestly amazed that that was even possible. It was pretty filling for me but I wasn't super hungry. I would probably also buy the chia pudding or almond butter oats if I was feeling particularly ravenous.

I wondered what they did with the extra food they don't sell, and the company donates unsold food that is still fresh to local area pantries (according to their FAQ).
