# Introduction

**What is epidemiology?**
This fundamental question is too basic to be addressed in the text, although it is useful to answer for anyone coming in with a different background (e.g. me, trained as a physicist, now dabbling with statistics).
Per [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology),

> Epidemiology is the study and analysis of the distribution (who, when, and where), patterns and determinants of health and disease conditions in defined populations.

Clearly it is related to [public health](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health).
Epidemiologists identify factors that impact health, design studies and collect data to learn about them, analyze the data and draw conclusions, then inform the public of what they learned and implement policies to improve the public's health.
An analogy I like is that epidemiologists are to populations as doctors are to individual patients.

Epidemiology encompasses a large scope and therefore is quite interdisciplinary.
Two epidemiologists may perform very different tasks day to day.
Quoting again the previous Wikipedia article on what epidemiology entails,

> Epidemiologists rely on other scientific disciplines like biology to better understand disease processes, statistics to make efficient use of the data and draw appropriate conclusions, social sciences to better understand proximate and distal causes, and engineering for exposure assessment.

Given the scope and practical importance of epidemiology, reliability and utility of epidemiologic findings are paramount.
